# Acceleration-for-ACO-algorithm
This project includes two versions of ACO algorithm.

## Description 

- ####ACO_CPU
The ACO_CPU folder is the serial version of ACO algorithm. It is used as a reference to estimate the speed up.

- ####ACO_GPU
The ACO_GPU folder is the parallel version of ACO algorithm using GPU. It has get several times speed up than the serial version.
